# RxJavaGiveATry

Just a little dive into all RxJava stuff to fix all the problems with this instrument. Thats not some app.
Its just code samples separated from greate sense. 

Training with RxJava in Android if you want the easiest explanation.

I have a few usefull apps separeted into modules.
1. Contact Manager(RxJava + SqlLite)
2. TMDB Movies app(Retrofit, Room + RxJava
3. Simple ToDo App

And inside rxjavawithkotlin repo RxJava + Kotlin examples.
