# RxJavaGiveATry

Just a little dive into all RxJava stuff to fix all the problems with this instrument. Thats not some app.
Its just code samples separated from greate sense. 

Training with RxJava in Android if you want the easiest explanation.

And also i created every step training activity for every theme, operator e.t.c. So this means that you can take this code and test it by launching some activities in a phone. And even build something more complicated.
